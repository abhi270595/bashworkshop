Why / where / when scripting ?
    * mostly in interpreted language
    * small scale programs/automation
    * super-set of this language is the programming language(ex: C++, Python)
    * ex: Bash, Python

Variables 
    
    loosly typed
        * need not specipy data type during variable declaration
        * could change the type during the run-time
    assignment
        * leave no space before and after the equal to sign
        * ex: a="Hello World"
    string
        * represented by anything inside double quotes
        * ex: "Hi there...", "0123456789"
    wild cards
        * "*" - denotes everything
        * "?" - denotes the presence the charactor just preceding it
        * "." - denotes a single charactor
    int
        * [0-9] digits, similar to all other languages
        * assignment: var=123
    Scripting Language

i/o o/p

    echo command
    read command
    //you dont have to initialise variable to read into it 

Conditional loop
    
    if
        * syntax:
          if <condition>
          then
                <statements>
          elif <condition>
          then
                <statements>
          .
          .
          .
          else
                <statements>
          fi
        * <some link to the condition cases>

    while
        * syntax
          while <condition>
          do
                <statements>
          done [< FILE]

    switch case:
        * do not use switch key word
        * syntax
          case expression in
          pattern1 )
                <statements> ;;
          pattern2 )
                <statements> ;;
          .
          .
          .
          esac
        * for default part:
                patter can be given as "*" ==> which returns true for all
                arguements other than the ones given in the above cases
